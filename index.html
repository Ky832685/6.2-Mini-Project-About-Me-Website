<h1>KWADWO YEBOAH ASI </h1>
  
 <p><em>I was quite anxious on the first day of ninth grade. I was introduced to fresh information that I was unfamiliar with. It was hard and incredibly confusing to move around the school.The first time I saw a brawl in the hallways, school suddenly became enjoyable. </em></p>
 
  
  <p><b>I want to picture myself studying computer science or IT engineering in college in three years. I'm excited to start working at Tishman Speyer.</b></p
